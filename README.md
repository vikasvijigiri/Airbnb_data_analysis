# Airbnb Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize data from Airbnb listings to uncover insights and trends related to prices, and it's dependence on variables such as property types, accommodate type, location, bathrooms, bedrooms and other features. By leveraging the data, we can gain a better understanding of the Airbnb market and provide useful information for both hosts and guests.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset that includes information about Airbnb listings, such as:

- **Price**: The price of the listing per night.
- **Property Type**: The type of property (e.g., apartment, house, etc.).
- **Location**: The geographical location of the property.
- **Other Features**: Other relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, amenities, host information, etc.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes the following analysis and visualizations:

- **Price Distribution**: An analysis of the distribution of prices across different property types and locations.
- **Property Types**: An examination of the most common property types and their average prices.
- **Location Analysis**: An analysis of how location affects price and availability.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Insights into trends in listings and prices over time.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring correlations between different features such as property type, number of bedrooms, and price.

## Requirements

To run the analysis and generate the visualizations, you will need:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later.
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `streamlit` and other data analysis and visualization libraries.
